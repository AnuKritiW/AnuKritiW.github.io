  Hi, I'm Anu and I'm a rising Junior, studying Computer Science at the School of Computing (SoC) at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I am also studying in a parallel academic programme, the University Scholars' Programme (USP) at NUS.

  <mark>OpenGL</mark>,
  <mark>JavaScript</mark>,
  <mark>Python</mark>,
  <mark> HTML & CSS</mark>, and

  I also have experience with
  <mark>Film and Stage Direction</mark>,
  <mark>Screenwriting and Playwriting</mark>,
  <mark>Post-production for film</mark> and
  <mark>Stage Management</mark>.

  Currently, in my free time, I have set out to pick up <mark>Maya</mark> and <mark>Houdini</mark>.

  Watching reruns of *Gilmore Girls* and *Friends* are an absolute must. *Legally Blonde* and *Toy Story* are my other guilty pleasures. Spotify is also a daily essential! Without it, days would be too quiet.

  I crave adventure. Usually, adventure takes the form of travel, and I am lucky to have had the opportunity to visit places such as Boston, Paris, London, Thailand, India, China, Australia, etc. and I hope that I find myself embarking on more similar grand adventures.
  Mini-adventures within Singapore are also refreshing escapes from the ordinary. Doses of spontaneity are imperitive. :)
