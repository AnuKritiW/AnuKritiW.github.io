   Key courses I have taken at NUS include Computer Graphics (CS3241). I will be taking Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CS3243), Introduction to Media Computing (CS2108), Information Retrieval (CS3245), and a playwriting module (UAR2208) in the coming semester in early 2019.

    I am directing a play as part of *USP Productions*, titled *Sixty-One*, which will be performed in late Jan 2019 at the National Library. I learnt the my technical stage skills, such as stage lighting, sounds and visual effects, as a Stage Manager for USP Productions' 2018 play titled 'The Dark Web'. 

   I am also a member of the NUS film club, *NUStudios*, and attended their semester long *film school*, where I attended weekly workshops to learn the different aspects of film-making.
