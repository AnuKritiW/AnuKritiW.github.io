    *Reverie* is a 37-minute film made for USP Freshman Orientation Camp. The film was split into two parts, Renaissance and Reminisce, and was screened in a series of clips over the course of two camps.
    I was the <mark>Director</mark>, <mark>Screenwriter</mark>, <mark>Editor</mark> and <mark>Colorist</mark> on the production.

    This was my first time Directing a film, and I was blessed with a wonderful team. Since it was a film for an orientation camp, it carried with it some constraints, such as having to represent the 6 'houses' of the college
    (houses kind of like in Hogwarts). This meant that our main cast was decided before our script was. Writing a compelling short story with 6 main cast members proved to be a challenge as we wanted to do each of the characters
    justice, while also having an exciting plot for the new students to follow throughout the two camps. The theme, Reverie, was also decided prior to the film, which was an added constraint. After much discussion, my team and I
    deicded on drawing inspiratoin from *Black Mirror* and *Inception*, and created a story in which our main cast were criminals, who hacked into other criminals' dreams to retrive a password. Their only goal was to steal money.
    We had to push for this idea during the pitch and I'm glad we succeeded in achieving something different from most orientation films.

    Location, scheduling, even stolen costumes, were just some of the constraints and challenges we faced during the shoot, but with some post production magic, most inconsistencies can be covered up. :) I was the only one in my
    team who had made films before, and as such in addition to directing and editing, I also taught my team the basics of film-making which I had learnt at film school, and over the few film making experiences I'd had thus far.
    I lined the scripts and went through it every morning with the director of photography. We tried to be ambitious with many shots. In particular, we have a []~5-minute one-take](www.youtube.com)
    which I'm really proud of. The shot took one hour to choreograph. The 'backstage' video of this take can be found [here](www.youtube.com). In another take, we used a [wheely-chair to shoot two people walking](www.youtube.com).
    This is an example of the many different ways we adapted to the little resources we had to take relatively ambitious shots. Of course, as with any film, we also had a lot of fun! The [blooper reel](www.youtube.com) is testament to that.

    *Transit* is a short film I made with 3 friends for a 52 hour film competition 'Point and Shoot 2018'. I was the <mark>Producer</mark> and <mark>Editor</mark> for this film. We had an absolutely amazing time shooting this film.
    The night the film theme was released ('mirror'), my team met and stayed up the entire night trying to write a script for the project. We explored many possible ideas and finally settled on filming an interaction between an Uber driver and
    passenger who once knew each other. The next day, we shot the film - fitting 6 people into a car that could barely fit 4. Filming in a car brought it's own challenges, especially with camera stability and sound, but my team and I managed to
    find ways to adapt to them.

    We spent the final day of the competition in the studio, using primarily Adobe Premier Pro for post-production. My most distinct memory from that day was the final hour rush, when I was working on colour grading,
    while my team mates were each working on the same clips simultaneously for sound, subtitles, preparing our submission etc. Watching our film at midnight just after our submission was a moment of pure unadultered joy, which, in addition to
    the wonderful 52 hours I'd had, affirmed my choice to focus on film and story-telling.

    Transit was also given an [Honourable Mention at the Frameworks Film Festival 2018](https://www.frameworksfilmfestival.com/honourable-mentions).
