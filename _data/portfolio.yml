    *Transit* is a short film I made with 3 friends for a 52 hour film competition 'Point and Shoot 2018'. I was the <mark>Producer</mark> and <mark>Editor</mark> for this film. We had an absolutely amazing time shooting this film.
    The night the film theme was released ('mirror'), my team met and stayed up the entire night trying to write a script for the project. We explored many possible ideas and finally settled on filming an interaction between an Uber driver and
    passenger who once knew each other. The next day, we shot the film - fitting 6 people into a car that could barely fit 4. Filming in a car brought it's own challenges, especially with camera stability and sound, but my team and I managed to
    find ways to adapt to them. We spent the final day of the competition in the studio, using primarily Adobe Premier Pro for post-production. My most distinct memory from that day was the final hour rush, when I was working on colour grading,
    while my team mates were each working on the same clips simultaneously for sound, subtitles, preparing our submission etc. Watching our film at midnight just after our submission was a moment of pure unadultered joy, which, in addition to
    the wonderful 52 hours I'd had, affirmed my choice to focus on film and story-telling.

    Transit was also given an [Honourable Mention at the Frameworks Film Festival 2018](https://www.frameworksfilmfestival.com/honourable-mentions).
