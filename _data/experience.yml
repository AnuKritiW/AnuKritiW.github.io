    I volunteered at a local community foundation center to teach underpriviledged students, aged 7-13, computing.
    I am especially proud of a course I developed and led, teaching young students (ages 7 to 10) higher order thinking through film. The course was titled HOTShots.
    In addition to this, I planned a course on Machine Learning, after which the students (ages 10 to 12) participated in a hackathon.
    I have also tutored in various other courses which taught the students things such as Scratch and Robotics.
