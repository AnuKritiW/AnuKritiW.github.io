    I worked as a Graphics Engineer Intern at [Quantum Inventions](http://www.quantuminventions.com/), a subsidiary of [Continental](https://www.continental.com/en).
    I developed Douglas-Peucker, Rheumann-Whitkam and Visvalingam-Whyatt line simplification algorithms for map rendering in C++ on Android Studio.
